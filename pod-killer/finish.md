# Experiment Complete!

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the Pod Delete chaos experiment.

## Key Learnings

- Chaos Engineering helps validate system resilience
- Pod Delete experiment tests Kubernetes self-healing capabilities
- Experiments can identify potential weaknesses in the system

## Further Learning

- Try other types of chaos experiments (e.g., network latency, CPU stress)
- Explore more features of the Litmus framework
- Design chaos experiments for your real development environment

Thank you for completing this experiment!
